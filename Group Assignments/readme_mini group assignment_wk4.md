### Food Access in the City of Washington D.C. ###
***Mini Group Assignment***

Group Members: Emily Biro, Christopher Do, Brittney Lu, Rachel Seiberg ([Link to Proposal](https://github.com/rseiberg/food_access_dc/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/readme_group%20assignment%201_project%20proposal.md))

***Roles***

We intend to have each group member explore and lead data visualization for one or two food access indicators as it relates to census data. Currently, we have too many variables and will need to edit our variables and indicators down to have a more clear and direct midterm deliverable. As such, this week, we will each take on our census variable from last week, along with a relevant food access indicator to visualize these relationships. After this point, we will decide on which census variable we want to focus on and will assess additional food access variables from this lens. Alternatively, we may visualize multiple census variables along multiple food access indicators if it is feasible within our project timeline.
* Emily Biro: Income Variation & Healthy Corner Store Locations
* Christopher Do: Vehicle Ownership & Grocery Stores
* Brittney Lu: Population Density & Food Banks
* Rachel Seiberg: Race & Low Food Access Areas

***Status Updates***

Overall, morale is high! We've had good communication so far, and anticipate that things might get a little more busy with the midterm project, but we're all looking forward to having fun with the data :)

***Data Updates***

Emily Biro [Healthy Corner Stores, 2018](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::healthy-corner-stores/explore?location=38.890899%2C-77.026467%2C12.53)
* Begun data exploration and digging into potential relationships between income variation and healthy corner store locations within the different wards in DC i.e. higher concentration of high income areas and healthy corner store locations, concentration of locations nearby certain neighborhood indicators, etc.

Brittney Lu [Food Bank Locations, 2018](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::joyful-food-market/explore?location=38.890868%2C-77.026467%2C12.53)
*    

Rachel Seiberg [Low Food Access Areas, 2018](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::low-food-access-areas/explore?location=38.890868%2C-77.026467%2C12.53)
* Looking at the relationship between race/ethnicity and low food access areas. I intend to look at the city scale, as well as at the ward scale, because I discovered last week just how segregated D.C.’s wards are. I expect to see more low food access areas in the eastern part of D.C., specifically the SE ward.
* I am utilizing Social Explorer data on race/ethnicity and Open Data D.C.’s data on low food access areas from 2018. 

***Concerns***

Major Concerns
1. Not enough data points for each dataset to display meaningful connections/relationships 
2. Too many variables and indicators - we will need to decide which census variable we want to focus on as it relates to our food access variables
3. Appropriate execution of codes in Python to display useful data

Minor Concerns
1. Time management
2. Arranging internal group deadlines that work with everyone's schedule
