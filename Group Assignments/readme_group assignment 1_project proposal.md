### Introduction to Research Question ###

This group project will assess the overall food environment in the City of Washington D.C. by identifying and mapping food amenities and disamenities across all D.C. wards. We intend to use a variety of indicators to address the following research question(s):

***Main Question***
* What is the overall food landscape for the City of Washington D.C.?

***Sub Questions***
* Does healthy food access vary across wards? If so, how might this impact different demographics?
* Are there areas in the City of Washington D.C. that have greater access to healthy food?
* Are there areas in the City of Washington D.C. that have a higher concentration of unhealthy food options?
* Is there a visual relationship between DC demographics, food environments, and health outcomes?
* What are important indicators of healthy and unhealthy food access?

These research questions are more descriptive in nature so that we can create a baseline understanding of how food access is spatially distributed in the City of Washington D.C., and how food access may vary across wards and demographics, based on existing data and visualizations. 
### Explanation of Why This Research is Important to the Group, to Others, and What is at Stake ###
This group project will focus on assessing the spatial relationships between race/ethnicity, income, food environments, and health outcomes. We recognize that access to nutritious, affordable, and diverse food options can help promote individual and community health and wellbeing. However, we understand that these food options are not always evenly distributed across geographies and communities. Often, the lack of healthy food and/or over-concentration of unhealthy foods found in certain communities is in response to racist policymaking and land use practices, which contributes to [food apartheid](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/nina-sevilla/food-apartheid-racialized-access-healthy-affordable-food). This can lower an individual‚Äôs or community‚Äôs [food security and sovereignty](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2021.686492/full), and facilitate [inequities in health outcomes](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/resources/understanding-health-disparities/food-accessibility-insecurity-and-health-outcomes.html#:~:text=Food%20insecurity%20and%20the%20lack,disorders%20and%20other%20chronic%20diseases%20.). Our hope is that this project can increase our understanding of these interacting issues, identify areas of opportunity for the City of Washington D.C., and contribute to growing evidence that food environments are intentionally designed and unequally experienced.
### Description of the Spatial Scope and Why Space and/or Time is Relevant to this Project ###
The project will have a spatial focus limited to the City of Washington D.C. Data may be concentrated at the census tract or block level, but local context will be provided at the neighborhood, ward, zip code, and quadrant level while assessing similarities and differences in food access and availability. The time frame will be focused on the most current datasets available, preferably after 2018, and time series data may be used to map the locations of new grocery stores (including health food stores), corner stores, community gardens, liquor stores, and farmers markets. Space is a pivotal dimension for understanding the distribution of healthy and unhealthy food across the city; preliminary research suggests food access is not distributed equitably. Time could be an important dimension for gauging progression of food access, though the project will primarily aim to capture the current landscape of food access.
### Preliminary, Definitive Description of Data Sources (with links) ###
Most of the food-related and health-specific data will be sourced from [Open Data DC](https://opendata.dc.gov/) and demographic-related data will be sourced from [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/), though we anticipate that other platforms may be used as the project progresses.

### Project Scope (Explanation of Intended Analysis and Resulting Visualizations) ###
Based on our initial understanding of food environments and available data through Open Data DC and Social Explorer, we intend to explore the following as variables in our analysis: 
* Healthy Food Indicators (or "good" food resources) ‚Üí grocery store locations, organic grocery store locations, community garden locations, farmers market locations, healthy corner stores
* Unhealthy Food Indicators (or "bad" food resources) ‚Üí liquor retailer locations, fast food restaurant locations
* Food Access Baseline ‚Üí low food access area, food bank locations

We assume that these indicators will reveal where there are opportunities for healthy food access, along with clear concentrations of healthy food access and concentrations of unhealthy food access across the City of Washington D.C. 's wards. For further analysis, we are mapping overlays of 2020 census data covering race/ethnicity, income level, population density, and vehicle ownership to see if there may be visual correlations between food access and demographic characteristics, both across the City at large and between wards. Finally, we are also considering mapping an overlay of an available health index to see if there may be a visual relationship between demographics, food access, and general health outcomes. 

The resulting visualizations that we hope to generate include:
* Contextual base maps of the City of Washington D.C. including demographic characteristics and various food indicators
* Contextual charts of food resources counts by ward and zip code
* A layer showing existing data on the levels of food access across the City of Washington D.C.
* A layer showing the distribution of food amenities and disamenities (color coded based on various food indicators) across the City of Washington D.C. wards
* A layer showing general health status at the ward and/or neighborhood level, along with at the city level

### Conclusion and Research Goals ###
The aim of this research is to develop a better understanding of the City of Washington D.C.‚Äôs food environment, and what correlations exist between food access, demographics, and health. Broadly, we anticipate that there will be similarities in these spatial relationships based on the existing research and literature, such that food access can vary along lines of race and income, and that where there is less access to and choice of foods, there will be poorer general health outcomes or overall wellbeing. We also hope that our research may reveal what the City of Washington D.C. may be doing to address disparities in food access, with opportunities for various strategies that can be scaled across different regions.
